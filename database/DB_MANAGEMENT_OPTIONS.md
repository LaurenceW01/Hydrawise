# Database Management Interface Options

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: DB Browser for SQLite (FREE)**

**Download**: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
**Why it's perfect for you**:
- ✅ **Direct SQLite editing** - Edit tables, add/delete rows, modify data
- ✅ **Visual query builder** - No SQL knowledge required for basic operations
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Changes are immediately saved to your database
- ✅ **Data export** - Export to CSV, JSON, SQL for Google Sheets if needed
- ✅ **Schema viewer** - See all tables, columns, relationships visually
- ✅ **No setup required** - Just download and point to your irrigation_data.db file

**Perfect for**:
- Viewing all your irrigation data in tables
- Adding test data quickly
- Modifying zone information
- Cleaning up duplicate entries
- Running SQL queries with a visual interface

## 🌐 **Google Sheets Integration Options**

### **Option A: One-Way Export (Simplest)**
Create a script that exports database data to Google Sheets periodically:
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ✅ Great for viewing and sharing data
- ❌ No direct database editing (changes don't sync back)

### **Option B: Two-Way Sync (Complex)**
Build a system that syncs Google Sheets ↔ Database:
- ✅ Full editing capability in Google Sheets
- ✅ Shareable and collaborative
- ❌ Requires Google Sheets API setup
- ❌ Complex conflict resolution needed
- ❌ Risk of data corruption if multiple people edit

### **Option C: Web Dashboard (Recommended for sharing)**
Create a simple web interface using Streamlit or Flask:
- ✅ Professional interface
- ✅ Real-time database connection
- ✅ Controlled editing with validation
- ✅ Can be shared via URL

## 🛠️ **Other Free Database Tools**

### **DBeaver (FREE Community Edition)**
- ✅ Professional-grade database tool
- ✅ Supports many database types
- ✅ Advanced query capabilities
- ❌ Might be overkill for SQLite

### **SQLite Studio (FREE)**
- ✅ Specifically designed for SQLite
- ✅ Lightweight and fast
- ✅ Good visual query builder
- ✅ Data editing capabilities

### **Adminer (Web-based, FREE)**
- ✅ Web interface - access from any browser
- ✅ Can be hosted locally
- ✅ Direct database editing
- ❌ Requires web server setup

2. Install and open the application
3. File → Open Database → Select your `irrigation_data.db`
4. Click on "Browse Data" tab
5. Select any table from dropdown (scheduled_runs, actual_runs, zones, etc.)
