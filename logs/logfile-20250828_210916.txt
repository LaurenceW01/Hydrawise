  [FILTER] Anomaly filtering enabled - too_high/too_low values replaced with estimates

[OK] Variance within acceptable range

[DETAILS] Zone-by-Zone Analysis:

  Zone: Front Color (S)
    Usage:           53.50 gallons
    Calculated:      54.50 gallons
    Variance:        -1.00 gallons (  -1.8%)

    Runs:                2 runs
    Estimated:           0 runs (  0.0%)
    Flags: normal:2
    [ANALYSIS] Flow rate appears accurate when anomalies filtered out

  Zone: Front Left Beds (D)
    Usage:           12.50 gallons
    Calculated:      13.00 gallons
    Variance:        -0.50 gallons (  -3.8%)

    Runs:                1 runs
    Estimated:           0 runs (  0.0%)
    Flags: normal:1
    [ANALYSIS] Flow rate appears accurate when anomalies filtered out

  Zone: Front Planters & Pots
    Usage:            2.00 gallons
    Calculated:       2.00 gallons
    Variance:         0.00 gallons (  +0.0%)
    Actual Reported:     0.00 gallons
    Reporting Accuracy:    0.0%
    Unreported:       2.00 gallons
    Runs:                2 runs
    Estimated:           2 runs (100.0%)
    Flags: zero_reported:2
    [ANALYSIS] Flow meter likely not working - mostly zero readings | Flow rate appears accurate when anomalies filtered out | Poor flow meter accuracy - frequent zero readings despite run activity

  Zone: Rear Bed/Planters at Pool (M)
    Usage:            6.50 gallons
    Calculated:       7.80 gallons
    Variance:        -1.30 gallons ( -16.7%)
    Actual Reported:     6.50 gallons
    Reporting Accuracy:   83.3%
    Unreported:       1.30 gallons
    Runs:                3 runs
    Estimated:           0 runs (  0.0%)
    Flags: normal:3
    [ANALYSIS] Flow rate may be too high - consider reducing average_flow_rate | Drip/micro irrigation may have lower actual flow than configured rate

  Zone: Rear Left Bed at House (M/D)
    Usage:            6.00 gallons
    Calculated:       6.00 gallons

[METHODOLOGY]
  Usage Methodology: Uses the usage column which contains actual or estimated values
  Calculation Methodology: Uses zone flow_rate_gpm * duration_minutes
  Positive Variance: Usage > Calculated (possible flow meter over-reporting)
  Negative Variance: Usage < Calculated (possible flow meter under-reporting or issues)
[SUCCESS] Daily comparison report completed
