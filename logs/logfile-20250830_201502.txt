[METHODOLOGY]
  Usage Methodology: Uses the usage column which contains actual or estimated values
  Calculation Methodology: Uses zone flow_rate_gpm * duration_minutes
  Positive Variance: Usage > Calculated (possible flow meter over-reporting)
  Negative Variance: Usage < Calculated (possible flow meter under-reporting or issues)
[SUCCESS] Daily comparison report completed
