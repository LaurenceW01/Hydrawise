# Hydrawise Irrigation Failure Alert System - Master Plan

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build an **irrigation failure alert system** that detects when zones are not running or planned not to run due to controller schedule changes, immediately alerting the user to take action to ensure plants receive necessary watering through manual zone control via API.

## 🚨 Critical Use Case
**Plant Protection Priority**: When the Hydrawise controller cancels, suspends, or reduces watering due to:
- Sensor failures ("Aborted due to sensor input")
- Weather adjustments
- System malfunctions
- Manual suspensions
- Schedule modifications

**User needs immediate notification** to manually water affected zones before plants suffer.

## 🚀 Detailed Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Alert Foundation - Real-time Monitoring**

#### **1.1 Failure Detection Research**
- **Research** failure patterns from your Excel data:
  - "Aborted due to sensor input" 
  - "Cancelled due to manual start"
  - "Watering cycle suspended"
  - Weather-related cancellations
- **Identify** critical timing: when to detect problems vs normal adjustments
- **Define** alert thresholds: zones that should run but won't protect plants

#### **1.2 Real-time Schedule Monitor**
- **Build** continuous monitoring of current day schedule using web scraping
- **Detect** schedule changes in real-time (zones removed, cancelled, suspended)
- **Track** expected vs actual watering throughout the day
- **Flag** zones that haven't run when they should have by now

#### **1.3 Alert Engine**
- **CRITICAL ALERTS**: Zones that won't run today (immediate plant risk)
- **WARNING ALERTS**: Reduced watering (shorter duration, fewer cycles)
- **SYSTEM ALERTS**: Controller offline, sensor failures, system suspension
- **Smart filtering**: Avoid false alarms during normal weather-based adjustments

#### **1.4 Emergency Dashboard**

### **Phase 3: Intelligence Layer - Pattern Detection**

#### **3.1 Historical Analysis**
- **Parse Excel data** to understand common failure patterns
- **Seasonal trends**: When failures are most likely
- **Zone vulnerability**: Which zones fail most often
- **Recovery patterns**: How quickly normal schedules resume

#### **3.2 Predictive Alerts**
- **Early warning**: Detect conditions that often lead to failures
- **Maintenance alerts**: Sensor issues, low pressure, system problems
- **Weather integration**: Predict schedule changes before they happen
- **Trend analysis**: Long-term watering pattern changes

#### **3.3 Smart Recommendations**
- **Optimal manual timing**: Best times to run manual watering
- **Duration suggestions**: How long to run based on missed watering
- **Efficiency tips**: Minimize water waste during manual operations
- **Schedule adjustments**: Suggest permanent schedule improvements

### **Phase 4: Production System - Automated Plant Protection**

#### **4.1 Automated Response**
- **Smart automation**: Automatically start critical zones when safe
- **User approval**: Require confirmation for automated actions
- **Backup scheduling**: Alternative watering plans when primary fails
- **Integration testing**: Ensure automated responses work reliably

#### **4.2 Advanced Monitoring**
- **Multi-day tracking**: Detect cumulative watering deficits
- **Plant health metrics**: Track zones with recurring issues
- **System health**: Monitor controller and sensor reliability
- **Performance optimization**: Continuous improvement of alert accuracy

#### **4.3 Reporting & Maintenance**
- **Weekly summaries**: System reliability and intervention frequency
- **Maintenance schedules**: Proactive sensor and system checks
- **Plant health reports**: Zones that need schedule adjustments
- **System optimization**: Recommendations for permanent improvements

## 🚨 Alert Types & Triggers

### **CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required**
- ❌ **Zone won't run today**: Scheduled zone cancelled/suspended
- ❌ **Sensor failure**: "Aborted due to sensor input" pattern
- ❌ **System offline**: Controller not responding
- ❌ **Emergency stop**: All zones manually suspended

### **WARNING - Monitor Closely**
- ⚠️ **Reduced duration**: Zone running shorter than usual
- ⚠️ **Delayed start**: Zone starting much later than scheduled
- ⚠️ **Partial failure**: Some cycles cancelled, others completed
- ⚠️ **Weather override**: Rain delay potentially too conservative

### **INFO - Awareness Only**
- ℹ️ **Schedule adjustment**: Normal weather-based changes
- ℹ️ **Manual start**: User manually started zone
- ℹ️ **Cycle complete**: All zones completed successfully
- ℹ️ **Maintenance mode**: Planned system maintenance
